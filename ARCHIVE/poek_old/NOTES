All numeric constants are treated as immutable parameters.
. At least for this prototype, this significantly simplifies the logic
  for walking expression trees in C++

Immutable parameters are not converted to their constant values when
constructing expressions.  In Pyomo, we have:

  m = ConcreteModel
  m.p = Param(initialize=3.0)
  m.q = Param(initialize=4.0)
  e = m.p/m.q
  # e is a float with value 3/4

In poek we have:

  p = parameter(3, False)
  q = parameter(4, False)
  e = 3/4
  # e is an expression tree

Need to add logic to control what happens when other is 'junk'


TODO: Add support for explicit number types (e.g. numpy), and for numpy data in general
